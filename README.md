## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my personal portfolio repository. This application is a full-stack showcase designed to highlight my journey and skills in **Cloud Computing (AWS)**, **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**, and **Data Analytics**.

The site serves as a central hub for my technical projects, certifications, and professional experience, demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between complex backend infrastructure and user-friendly frontend experiences.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is built using a modern, type-safe stack:

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Backend / API:** Node.js, Express (located in `/server`)
* **Database ORM:** Drizzle ORM
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)

## 📂 Repository Structure
The codebase is organized as a monorepo containing both client and server logic:

```bash
├── client/          # React frontend application
├── server/          # Node.js/Express backend & API routes
├── shared/          # Shared TypeScript types between client and server
├── drizzle.config.ts # Database configuration
└── vite.config.ts   # Vite build configuration
